# quad-sphere
Usually when you make a sphere by subdividing a cube it comes out warped. 
This addon allows you to create perfectly round spheres, but with quad topology.

I created this Quad Sphere using <a href="https://joshuaknauber.gumroad.com/l/serpens-b3d">Serpens</a>, an awesome node based scripting addon for making your own addons. I highly recommend buying this right now if you are interested in creating your own Blender addons.
